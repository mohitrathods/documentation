Scheduling delivery dates
=========================

Giving accurate forecasted dates of delivery is vital for fulfilling customer expectations. Odoo
offers comprehensive lead time configuration, allowing coordination and planning of manufacturing
orders, deliveries, and receptions.

Types of lead times
===================

Lead times are interconnected and impact various stages of the order fulfillment process. Here's a
summary of the types of lead times in Odoo:

.. image:: scheduled_dates/all-lead-times.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Show graphic of all lead times working together.

-  **Customer lead time**: used as the default time frame for fulfilling customer orders, the
   customer lead time is the number of days from the date the sales order (SO) is confirmed to the
   date the products are shipped from the warehouse. This is also known as *delivery lead time*.
   :ref:`[Skip to section] <inventory/management/planning/scheduled/customer-LT>`

-  **Sales security lead time**: moves forward the *scheduled delivery date* by a specified number
   of days. This serves as a buffer to allow the team to prepare the outgoing shipment earlier,
   considering the possibility of delays in the fulfillment process. :ref:`[Skip to section]
   <inventory/management/planning/scheduled/sales-security-LT>`

-  **Purchase lead time**: the number of days from the confirmation of a purchase order (PO) to the
   receipt of products. It provides insight on the time it takes for products to arrive at the
   warehouse, facilitating effective scheduling and planning of supplier deliveries :ref:`[Skip to
   section] <inventory/management/planning/scheduled/purchase-LT>`

-  **Purchase security lead time**: advance the order deadline on a :abbr:`PO (Purchase Order)` by a
   specified number of days. This proactive approach of placing orders earlier mitigates the risk of
   vendor or shipping delays. Thus, for products that are replenish to order, the need appears on
   the *Replenishment report* earlier by the specified number of days. :ref:`[Skip to section]
   <inventory/management/planning/scheduled/purchase-security-LT>`

-  **Manufacturing lead time**: the number of days to complete manufacturing order from the date of
   confirmation. The lead time includes weekends, and is used to forecast an approximate date of
   production of a finished good.

-  **Manufacturing security lead time**: moves forward the scheduled date of the :abbr:`MO
   (Manufacturing Order)` by a specified number of days. When used in conjunction with
   :ref:`replenish to order <inventory/management/products/strategies>`, the security lead time
   makes the need appear earlier on the replenishment report. :ref:`[Skip to section]
   <inventory/management/planning/scheduled/manuf-security-LT>`

Sales - lead times
==================

Configure customer lead times and sales security lead times to automatically compute an *expected
delivery date* on a sales order (SO). The expected delivery date ensures a realistic setting of
*delivery dates* for shipment from the warehouse. Odoo issues a warning message if the set delivery
date is earlier than the expected date, as it may not be feasible to fulfill the order by that time,
impacting other warehouse operations.

.. example::
   A :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)` containing a `Coconut-scented candle` is confirmed on July 11. The
   product has a customer lead time of 14 days, and the business uses a sales security lead time of
   1 day. Based on the lead time inputs, Odoo suggests a delivery date in 15 days, on July 26th.

   .. image:: scheduled_dates/scheduled-date.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Set *Delivery Date* in a sales order. Enables delivery lead times feature.

View the following sections below to automatically compute expected delivery dates.

Customer lead time
------------------

Set the customer lead time on each the product form, by navigating to the product itself from
:menuselection:`Sales app --> Products --> Products`. Select the desired product and switch to the
:guilabel:`Inventory` tab. Under the :guilabel:`Customer Lead Time` field, fill in the number of
calendar days required to fulfill the delivery order from start to finish. Thus, customer lead time
has another name: delivery lead time.

.. example::
   Set a 14-day customer lead time for the `Coconut-scented candle` by navigating to its product
   form. Then, in the :guilabel:`Inventory` tab, type `14.00` days into the field,
   :guilabel:`Customer Lead Time`.

   .. image:: scheduled_dates/customer-LT.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Set *Customer Lead Time* on the product form.

.. _inventory/management/planning/scheduled/sales-security-LT:

Sales security lead time
------------------------

*Sales security lead time* is set globally for the business in :menuselection:`Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`. On the configuration page, under the :guilabel:`Advanced Scheduling`
heading, locate the box for :guilabel:`Security Lead Time for Sales` to enable the feature by
checking the box. Next, enter the desired number of calendar days. This security lead time is a
buffer notifying the team to prepare for outgoing shipments earlier than the scheduled date.

.. example::
   Setting the :guilabel:`Security Lead Time for Sales` to `1.00` day pushes forward the
   :guilabel:`Scheduled Date` of a :abbr:`DO (Delivery Order)` by a day. In that case, if a product
   is initially scheduled for delivery on April 6th, but with a one-day security lead time, the new
   scheduled date for the delivery order would be April 5th.

   .. image:: scheduled_dates/sales-security-LT.png
      :align: center
      :alt: View of the security lead time for sales configuration from the sales settings.

Deliver several products
------------------------

Configure order fulfillment for multiple products with different lead directly on the quotation
itself. In the :guilabel:`Other Info` tab, set the :guilabel:`Shipping Policy` to:

#. :guilabel:`As soon as possible` to deliver products as soon as they are ready. The
   :guilabel:`Scheduled Date` of the :abbr:`DO (Delivery Order)` is determined by adding today's
   date to the shortest lead time among the products in the order.

#. :guilabel:`When all products are ready` to wait to fulfill the entire order at once. The
   :guilabel:`Scheduled Date` of the :abbr:`DO (Delivery Order)` is determined by adding today's
   date to the longest lead time among the products in the order.

.. example::
   In a quotation containing 2 products, `Yoga mat` and `Resistance band`, the products have a lead
   time of 8 days and 5 days, respectively. Today's date is April 2nd.

   When the :guilabel:`Shipping Policy` is set to :guilabel:`As soon as possible`, the scheduled
   delivery date is 5 days from today: April 7th. On the other hand, selecting :guilabel:`When all
   products are ready` in this case configures the scheduled date to be 8 days from today: April
   10th.

Purchase - lead times
=====================

Simplify procurement by automatically determining dates to place orders from suppliers. Odoo
calculates the supplier shipment *receipt date* and :abbr:`PO (Purchase Order)` deadline based on
the required date the product is needed in the warehouse. By working backwards from the receipt
date, vendor lead times and purchase security lead times are taken into account to determine the
:abbr:`PO (Purchase Order)` deadline. This deadline  which is the date by which the order should be
confirmed to ensure timely arrival by the expected receipt date.

   :align: center
   :alt: Visualization of PO deadline and receipt date used with vendor lead times.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`PO scheduling with reordering rules <inventory/management/reordering_rules>`

Vendor lead time
----------------

To set a vendor lead time for an order to arrive from the vendor location to the warehouse, begin by
navigating to the product form through :menuselection:`Purchase app --> Products --> Products`.
Next, select the desired product and switch to the :guilabel:`Purchase` tab. In the editable vendor
pricelist, click the :guilabel:`Add a line` button to add vendor details, such as the
:guilabel:`Vendor` name, :guilabel:`Price` offered for the product, and lastly, the
:guilabel:`Delivery Lead Time`.

.. note::
   On the vendor pricelist, multiple vendors and lead times can be added. The default vendor and
   lead time selected will be the entry at the top of the list.

.. example::
   On the vendor pricelist of the product form, the :guilabel:`Delivery Lead Time` for the selected
   vendor is set to `10 days`.

   .. image:: scheduled_dates/set-vendor-LT.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Add delivery lead times to vendor pricelist on a product.

By setting the vendor lead time, the expected arrival date of the item is automatically determined
as the date of :abbr:`PO (Purchase Order)` confirmation plus the vendor lead time. This ensures that
warehouse employees are notified if the products do not arrive within the expected timeframe.

.. example::

   On a :abbr:`PO (Purchase Order)` confirmed on July 11th for a product configured with a 10-day
   vendor lead time, Odoo automatically sets the :guilabel:`Receipt Date` to July 21st. The receipt
   date will also appear as the :guilabel:`Scheduled Date` on the warehouse receipt form, accessible
   from the :guilabel:`Receipt` smart button from the :guilabel:`PO (Purchase Order)`.

   .. image:: scheduled_dates/receipt-date.png

.. _inventory/management/planning/scheduled/purchase-security-LT:

Purchase security lead time
---------------------------

*Purchase security lead time* is set globally for the business in :menuselection:`Inventory app -->
Configuration --> Settings`. On the configuration page, under the :guilabel:`Advanced Scheduling`
heading, locate the box for :guilabel:`Security Lead Time for Purchase` to enable the feature by
checking the box. Next, enter the desired number of calendar days. By configuring the security lead
time, a buffer is set to account for potential delays in supplier deliveries.

.. example::
   Setting the :guilabel:`Security Lead Time for Purchase` to `2.00` days pushes back the
   :guilabel:`Scheduled Date` of a receipt by a day. In that case, if a product
   is initially scheduled to arrive on April 6th, with a two-day security lead time, the new
   scheduled date for the receipt would be April 8th.

Manufacturing - lead times
==========================

Streamline the procurement of manufactured products by following Odoo's recommended manufacturing
order (MO) start dates based on the required date the product is needed in the warehouse. Determine
the :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)` deadline, which is the deadline to begin the manufacturing
process to complete the product by the scheduled delivery date, by configuring manufacturing lead
times and manufacturing security lead times.

.. image:: scheduled_dates/manuf-lead-times.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Visualization of the determination of planned MO date manufacturing lead times.

Manufacturing lead time
-----------------------

Configure the manufacturing lead time directly on the product form by navigating to
:menuselection:`Manufacturing app --> Products --> Products` and select the desired product. In the
:guilabel:`Inventory` tab of the product, specify the calendar days needed to the manufacture the
product in the field, :guilabel:`Manufacturing Lead Time`.

.. example::
   Specify a 14-day :guilabel:`Manufacturing Lead Time` for a product directly in the
   :guilabel:`Inventory` tab of the product.

   .. image:: scheduled_dates/set-manufacturing-LT.png
      :align: center
      :alt: View of the manufacturing lead time configuration from the product form

Establish a :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)` deadline based on the *expected delivery date*,
indicated in the :guilabel:`Scheduled Date` field of the :abbr:`DO (Delivery Order)`. The :abbr:`MO
(Manufacturing Order)` deadline, which is the :guilabel:`Scheduled Date` field on the **:abbr:`MO
(Manufacturing Order)`**, is calculated as the *expected delivery date* - manufacturing lead time.
This ensures that the manufacturing process begins on time to meet the delivery date. However it's
important to note that lead times are based on calendar days. Lead times do not consider weekends,
holidays, or work enter capacity.

   - :ref:`Configure automatic MO scheduling with reordering rules
     <inventory/management/reordering_rules>`
   - call to action to enable weekends and holidays through a custom development? (is this salesy)

.. example::
   A product's scheduled shipment date on the :abbr:`DO (Delivery Order)` is August 15th. The
   product requires 14 days to manufacture, so the latest date to start the :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing
   Order)` to meet the commitment date is August 1st.

.. _inventory/management/planning/scheduled/manuf-security-LT:

Manufacturing security lead time
--------------------------------

*Manufacturing security lead time* is set globally for the business in :menuselection:`Manufacturing
app --> Configuration --> Settings`. On the configuration page, under the :guilabel:`Planning`
heading, locate the box for :guilabel:`Security Lead Time` to enable the feature by checking the
box. Next, enter the desired number of calendar days. By configuring the security lead time, a
buffer is set to account for potential delays in the manufacturing process.

.. image:: scheduled_dates/manuf-security-LT.png
   :align: center
   :alt: View of the security lead time for manufacturing from the manufacturing app settings

.. example::
   A product has a scheduled shipment date on the :abbr:`DO (Delivery Order)` set for August 15th.
   The manufacturing lead time is 7 days, and manufacturing security lead time is 3 days. So, the
   :guilabel:`Scheduled Date` on the :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)` reflects the latest date to
   begin the manufacturing order. In this example, the :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)`'s planned
   date is August 5th.

Global example
==============

Consider the following example to see how all the lead times work together to ensure timely order
fulfillment. Configured lead times:

-  Sales security lead time: 1 day
-  Manufacturing security lead time: 2 days
-  Manufacturing lead time: 3 days
-  Purchase security lead time: 1 day
-  Vendor lead time: 4 days

The customer places an order for a manufactured product on September 1st, and the scheduled delivery
date from the warehouse is on September 20th. Odoo uses lead times and automated reordering rules to
schedule the necessary operations based on the outgoing shipment delivery date, September 20th:

.. image:: scheduled_dates/global-example.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Show timeline of how lead times work together to schedule warehouse operations.

-  **September 1st**: Sales order created, confirmed by salesperson

-  **September 9th**: Deadline to order components to ensure they arrive in time when manufacturing
   begins (4-day supplier lead time)

-  **September 13th**: Scheduled date of receipt for components. Was initially set to 9/14, but the
   1-day purchase security lead time pushed the date earlier by 1 day

-  **September 14th**: Deadline to begin manufacturing. Calculated by subtracting  the manufacturing
   lead time of 3 days and the manufacturing security lead time of 2 days from the expected delivery
   date of 9/19

-  **September 19th**: :guilabel:`Scheduled Date` on the delivery order form indicates the updated
   expected delivery date, which was originally set as 9/20. But the sales security lead time pushed
   the date forward by a day.
