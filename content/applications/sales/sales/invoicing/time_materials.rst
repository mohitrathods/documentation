===================================
Invoice based on time and materials
===================================

Invoicing that is based on time and/or materials is typically used during instances where it isn't
possible to accurately estimate the size of a project, or when it's difficult to predict when the
requirements of a project may change.

This is different from a fixed-price contract, wherein the owner agrees to pay the contractor a
grand total for the fulfillment of the contract -- no matter what the contractors need to pay their
employees, sub-contractors, vendors, and/or suppliers.

To best describe the use of invoicing based on time and materials using the Odoo *Sales* app, the
following will depict an example shown through the point of a view of a consultant. In this example,
from the viewpoint of a consultant, the documentation will describe how to invoice for time, various
expenses (e.g. transport, lodging, etc.), as well as purchases needed to fulfill an order.

Invoice time configuration
==========================

First, in order to accurately keep track of the progress of a project, the Odoo *Project* and
*Accounting* apps **must** be installed.

To install the *Project* app, navigate to :menuselection:`Main Odoo dashboard --> Apps`. Then,
on the :guilabel:`Apps` page, locate the :guilabel:`Project` app block, and click
:guilabel:`Activate`. The page automatically refreshes and returns to the main Odoo dashboard, where
the :guilabel:`Project` app is now available to access.

Repeat that process to install the *Accounting* application.

After installing, click the :guilabel:`Accounting` app icon from the main Odoo dashboard, and
navigate to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Settings`. On the :guilabel:`Settings` page, scroll
down to the :guilabel:`Analytics` section, and click the box next to :guilabel:`Analytic Accounting`
(if it's not already checked).

   :alt: How it looks to activate the Analytic Accounting setting in Odoo Accounting Setting page.

Then, click :guilabel:`Save` to save all changes.

Then, navigate to :menuselection:`Main Odoo dashboard --> Project app --> Configuration -->
Settings`. On the :guilabel:`Settings` page, in the :guilabel:`Time Management` section, click the
box beside the :guilabel:`Timesheets` feature (if it's not already checked).

Then, click :guilabel:`Save` to save all changes.

.. image:: time_materials/timesheets-feature.png
   :align: center
   :alt: What the Timesheets feature looks like on the Odoo Project settings page.

Configure service products
==========================

With the *Timesheets* feature activated in the *Project* app, it is now possible to invoice for time
spent on a project, but **only** when the following product configurations have been made.

.. important::
   Invoicing for time spent on a project is **only** possible with product's that have *Service* set
   as the *Product Type* on their product form.

To do that, first navigate to :menuselection:`Sales app --> Products --> Products`. On the
:guilabel:`Products` page, select the desired service product to be configured.

From the service product detail form, in the :guilabel:`General Information` tab, ensure the
:guilabel:`Product Type` is set to :guilabel:`Service`. Then, open the drop-down menu in the
:guilabel:`Invoicing Policy` field, and select :guilabel:`Based on Timesheets`.

Next, from the :guilabel:`Create on Order` drop-down menu, select :guilabel:`Project & Task`. That
means whenever a sales order is created with this specific service product, a new project and task
will be created.

.. image:: time_materials/service-product-general-settings.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The correct settings for Invoicing Policy and Create on Order fields for service product.

.. note::
   The option :guilabel:`Task` could be chosen from the :guilabel:`Create on Order` drop-down menu,
   instead. If :guilabel:`Task` is chosen, select an existing project to which it will be applied in
   the newly-revealed :guilabel:`Project` field drop-down menu, which only appears if
   :guilabel:`Task` is chosen in the :guilabel:`Create on Order` field.

Add time spent to sales order
=============================

After properly configuring a service product with the correct *Invoicing Policy* and *Create on
Order* options, it is possible to add time spent to a sales order.

To see that in action, navigate to :menuselection:`Sales app --> New` to open a blank quotation
form. Then, proceed to add a :guilabel:`Customer`, and in the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab, click
:guilabel:`Add a product`, and select the properly configured service product from the drop-down
menu.

Next, click :guilabel:`Confirm` to confirm the order.

After confirming the sales order, two smart buttons appear at the top of the order form:
:guilabel:`Projects` and :guilabel:`Tasks`.

.. image:: time_materials/projects-tasks-smart-buttons.png
   :align: center
   :alt: How the Projects and Tasks smart buttons look on a Sales Order in Odoo Sales.

If the :guilabel:`Projects` smart button is clicked, it reveals the specific project related to this
sales order. If the :guilabel:`Tasks` smart button is clicked, it reveals the specific project task
related to this sales order. Both are also accessible in the *Project* app, as well.

In order to add time spent on this sales order, select the :guilabel:`Tasks` smart button.

On that task detail form, select the :guilabel:`Timesheets` tab. From the :guilabel:`Timesheets`
tab, an employee(s) can be assigned to work on the project, and the time they spend working on the
task can be added by the employee(s) or by the person who created the sales order.

To add an employee, and the time spent working on the task, click :guilabel:`Add a line` in the
:guilabel:`Timesheets` tab. Then, select the appropriate :guilabel:`Date` and :guilabel:`Employee`.
There is also the option to add a breif description of the worked done during this time in the
:guilabel:`Description` column, but it's not required.

Lastly, enter the amount of time worked on the task in the :guilabel:`Hours Spent` column, and click
away to complete that line in the :guilabel:`Timesheets` tab.

.. note::
   The time entered in the :guilabel:`Hours Spent` column is immediately reflected in the
   :guilabel:`Allocated Time` field, located in the top-part of the task detail form, via access
   percentage that reflects how much of the total work has been done so far. That same information
   is found in the :guilabel:`Hours Spent` and :guilabel:`Remaining Hours` fields, located at the
   bottom of the :guilabel:`Timesheets` tab.

Repeat that process for however many employees and hours have been worked on the project.

Invoice time spent
==================

Once all the necessary employees and time spent has been added to the project task, return to the
sales order to invoice the customer for those hours. To do that, either click the :guilabel:`Sales
Order` smart button at the top of the task detail form, or return to the sales order via the
breadcrumb links, located in the upper-left of the screen.

Back on the sales order form, the time that was added to the task is reflected in the
:guilabel:`Order Lines` tab (in the :guilabel:`Delivered` column) and in the new :guilabel:`Recorded
Hours` smart button at the top of the top of the sales order.

To invoice the customer for time spent on the project, click :guilabel:`Create Invoice`, and select
:guilabel:`Regular invoice` from the :guilabel:`Create invoices` pop-up window. Then, click
:guilabel:`Create Draft Invoice`.

Doing so reveals a :guilabel:`Customer Invoice Draft`, clearly showing all the work that's been done
in the :guilabel:`Invoice Lines` tab.

.. tip::
   Pay attention to the :guilabel:`Analytic Distribution` column in the :guilabel:`Invoice Lines`
   tab, as that information is necessary to ensure other time/material invoicing tasks are completed
   properly (and accurately).

   .. image:: time_materials/invoice-lines-time.png

To complete the invoice, click :guilabel:`Confirm`, and complete the invoicing process.

Expenses configuration
======================

In order to track and invoice expenses related to a sales order, the Odoo *Expenses* app **must** be
installed.

To install the *Expenses* app, navigate to :menuselection:`Main Odoo dashboard --> Apps`. Then,
on the :guilabel:`Apps` page, locate the :guilabel:`Expenses` app block, and click
:guilabel:`Activate`. The page automatically refreshes and returns to the main Odoo dashboard, where
the :guilabel:`Expenses` app is now available to access.

Add expenses to sales order
===========================

To add an expense to a sales order, first navigate to the :menuselection:`Expenses` app. Then, from
the main *Expenses* dashboard, click :guilabel:`New`, which reveals a blank expense detail form.

On the expense form, add a :guilabel:`Description` of the expense (e.g. Hotel Stay, Plane Ticket,
etc.). Next, in the :guilabel:`Category` field, select the approrpiate option from the drop-down
menu (e.g. Meals, Miles, Travel & Accomodation, etc.)

.. note::
   Expense categories can be added and modified in the *Expenses* app by navigating to
   :menuselection:`Expenses app --> Configuration --> Expense Categories`.

Then, enter the total amount of the expense in the :guilabel:`Total` field, as well as any
:guilabel:`Included Taxes` that may apply. Next, ensure that the correct :guilabel:`Employee` is
selected, and designate who paid for the expense in the :guilabel:`Paid By` field: the
:guilabel:`Employee (to reimburse)` or :guilabel:`Company`.

Next, in the :guilabel:`Customer to Reinvoice` field, select the appropriate sales order from the
drop-down menu. Then, select that same sales order information from the :guilabel:`Analytic
Distribution` field, as well.

.. image:: time_materials/expense-detail-form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: How to properly fill out an expense form that's attached to a sales order in Odoo.

If there are any receipts that should be uploaded and attached to the expense, click the
:guilabel:`Attach Receipt` button, and upload the necessary documents to the expense. However, that
is **not** required.

When all the information has been entered, click :guilabel:`Create Report`, which reveals an
:guilabel:`Expense Report Summary`, detailing all the expense information that was just entered.

.. image:: time_materials/expense-report-summary.png
   :align: center
   :alt: How an Expense Report Summary looks in Odoo Expenses.

Then, there's the option to either :guilabel:`Submit to Manager` for approval, or :guilabel:`Report
in Next Payslip`. To showcase a complete flow in this example, select :guilabel:`Submit to Manager`,
then click :guilabel:`Approve` -- which is what a manager would do when approving expenses. Lastly,
click :guilabel:`Post Journal Entries`.

Invoice expenses
================

To invoice a customer for an expense on a sales order, navigate to the attached sales order, via the
:menuselection:`Sales` smart button at the top of the :guilabel:`Expense Report Summary` (or via the
*Sales* application).

Once on the sales order form, the newly-configured expense now has its own line in the
:guilabel:`Order Lines` tab, and can be invoiced to the customer.

.. image:: time_materials/invoice-expense-from-sales-order.png
   :align: center

Purchase configuration
======================

In order to invoice a customer for purchases made on a sales order, the *Purchase* application
**must** be installed.

To install the *Purchase* application, navigate to :menuselection:`Main Odoo dashboard --> Apps`.
Then, on the :guilabel:`Apps` page, locate the :guilabel:`Purchase` app block, and click
:guilabel:`Activate`. The page automatically refreshes and returns to the main Odoo dashboard, where
the :guilabel:`Purchase` app is now available to access.

Add purchase to sales order
===========================

To add a purchase to a sales order, a purchase order must first be created. To create a purchase
order, navigate to :menuselection:`Purchase app --> New` to reveal a blank purchase order form.

First, add a :guilabel:`Vendor` to the purchase order. Then, under the :guilabel:`Products` tab,
click the :guilabel:`extra column options` drop-down menu, represented by two horizontal lines with
dots on them, located to the far-right of the column headers. From that drop-down menu, select
:guilabel:`Analytic Distribution`.

tab of the purchase order form, proceed to add the product(s) to the purchase order. To do that,
click :guilabel:`Add a product`, and select the desired product from the drop-down menu.

.. important::
   In order for a purchase to be properly invoiced on a sales order, the product on the purchase
   order **must** be marked as :guilabel:`Can be Expensed`, have an :guilabel:`Invoicing Policy` set
   to :guilabel:`Delivered quantities` and the :guilabel:`At cost` option selected in the
   :guilabel:`Re-Invoice Expenses` field on its product form.

field to reveal an :guilabel:`Analytic` pop-up window.

Then, from the :guilabel:`Departments` drop-down menu select the analytic distribution associated
with the desired sales order to be invoiced for the purchase.

Products`.

.. note::
   If any serial/lot numbers must be entered before validation, click the :guilabel:`details` icon,
   represented by four horizontal lines, located to the far-right of the product line to reveal a
   :guilabel:`Detailed Operations` tab, in which the necessary :guilabel:`Lot/Serial Number(s)` and
   :guilabel:`Done` quantity can be added.

When ready, click :guilabel:`Confirm` to confirm the data and return to the purchase order. Then,
click :guilabel:`Validate` to validate the purchase order.

.. tip::
   Make sure to enter a :guilabel:`Bill Date` on the :guilabel:`Vendor Bill Draft` before
   confirming. If a :guilabel:`Bill Date` is *not* entered, an error window appears, requesting that
   information to be entered before confirmation can occur.

Then, click :guilabel:`Confirm` to confirm the vendor bill, which is then automatically added to the
sales order, where it can be invoiced directly to the customer attached to it.

Invoice purchase
